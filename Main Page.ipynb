These notebooks are organised within the Lab 1 Repo GitHub repository which can be forked and copied by following the link provided at the top of the page. The repository is organised into folders - one for each of the 4 weeks' challenges. Each week's folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file with the code as well as all the data required to run the code. Where data from APIs is used, the URL and token (if needed) is included in the code."
